    "### FAQ\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) Should we include the lines to import the libraries?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Answer:**  \n",
    "  It doesn't matter if you include extra import lines, as the grader will only call the specified functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Is it okay to submit my file with code outside of the functions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Answer:**  \n",
    "  Yes, you can include additional code outside of the functions as long as the entire script runs correctly when converted to a `.py` file.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Clarification:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The grader will first convert the Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) into a Python file (.py) and then run it.\n",
    "- **Note:** Please do not include any commands like `!pip install numpy` because they may break the conversion process and therefore the submission will not be graded."
